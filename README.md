# Windows Monitoring System

## Introduction

This Windows Monitoring System captures an image when the laptop is powered on, sends an email with the laptop's status, and checks if the person using the laptop is authorized. It utilizes system information retrieval, email sending capabilities, and captures a photo using the laptop's camera.

## Installation

1. Install Python 3 on your device.

2. Install required Python packages:

   ```bash
   pip install psutil opencv-python requests
   ```

3. Create a new folder "autostart" in "Program Files" and place the `main.py` file in it. The path should be:

   ```
   C:\Program Files\autostart\main.py
   ```

4. Paste the provided Python code into `main.py`.

5. Create a `script.bat` file with the following content:

   ```batch
   @echo off
   python.exe "C:\Program Files\autostart\main.py"
   ```

6. Create a shortcut for `script.bat`.

7. Press "Windows+R" and type "shell:startup" to open the startup folder.

8. Copy and paste the shortcut of `script.bat` into the startup folder.

## Usage

Once the system is set up, it will capture a photo when the laptop is powered on and send an email with the laptop's status. The script is set to run on startup.
